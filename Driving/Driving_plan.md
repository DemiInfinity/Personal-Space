# 6-Month Driving Preparation Plan

This plan outlines a 6-month journey to prepare for the driving theory test and develop practical driving skills, aiming to pass both the theory and practical driving tests. It’s designed for my **Adaptive Sprinter** and **Creative** ADHD style, using my **personal fit Git repository** with **commits as a diary** to track progress. The plan leverages my developer workflow, avoids scheduling apps, and integrates with my voice feminization goal for a cohesive approach.

## Overview
- **Goal**: Pass the driving theory test and prepare for the practical driving test within 6 months, gaining confidence as a driver.
- **Approach**:
  - **Micro-Studies**: 5–10 min daily theory sessions to learn rules, signs, and hazard perception, fitting my Sprinter bursts.
  - **Practical Practice**: Gradual driving practice (simulated or with an instructor) to build skills, starting with basics and progressing to complex maneuvers.
  - **Creative Logging**: Use `theory.md` and commits to log study, vent frustrations, and celebrate wins, framing it as a coding project.
  - **Adaptable Adjustments**: Rotate study methods (e.g., videos, quizzes) to avoid boredom, leveraging my adaptability.
  - **ADHD Support**: Address procrastination and forgetting with repo nudges and small wins to boost motivation.
  - **Integration**: Tie theory and driving practice to voice feminization tasks in the same repo.
- **Tools**:
  - Personal fit repo (`theory.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `wins.md`).
  - Python nudger script to prompt tasks.
  - Theory resources (e.g., official theory book, free apps like DVSA Theory Test Kit, YouTube videos).
  - Practical tools: Access to a car (with instructor or learner permit), simulator apps (optional).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Starting with basic theory knowledge and minimal driving experience.
  - Using free or accessible resources (e.g., UK DVSA materials if UK-based; adjust for your region).
  - No test booked yet, but aiming to book theory test by Month 3–4 and practical by Month 6.
  - Emotional barriers (e.g., anxiety about driving) may arise, addressed via venting in commits.

## Background
- **Theory Test**: Covers road signs, traffic rules, and hazard perception (e.g., UK: 50 multiple-choice questions, 43/50 to pass; hazard perception, 44/75). Requires memorization and quick thinking.
- **Practical Test**: Tests driving skills (e.g., UK: 40-min drive, maneuvers, independent driving). Requires confidence and muscle memory, like coding or voice training.
- **Timeline**: 6 months is enough to master theory (3–4 months) and build practical skills (4–6 months), with ~5–10 min daily theory and 1–2 weekly driving sessions.
- **ADHD Challenges**: Boring theory and forgetting tasks (like social messages) need engaging, low-friction tracking.

## 6-Month Plan
Divided into six 1-month phases, each with theory study, practical driving (where applicable), and repo-based tracking. Sessions are Sprinter-friendly (5–10 min theory, 30–60 min driving), with Creative logging to stay motivated.

### Month 1: Theory Foundation and Driving Basics
- **Focus**: Learn core theory (signs, basic rules), start driving basics (e.g., controls, starting/stopping).
- **Theory (5–10 min daily)**:
  - **Signs (5 min)**: Memorize 5–10 road signs (e.g., stop, yield) using mnemonics (e.g., “Red triangle = warning, like a code error”).

- **Practical (1–2x/week, 30 min)**:
  - Familiarize with car controls (e.g., steering, pedals) in a parking lot or with an instructor.
  - Practice starting, stopping, and basic steering (low speed).
- **Milestone**: Memorize 30–40 signs, understand 5–10 rules, drive comfortably in a controlled setting.

    "Study hazard perception for 5 min (e.g., watch video)",
    "Practice voice pitch for 2-3 min (e.g., hum or pitch slides)",
    "Practice voice resonance for 2-3 min (e.g., say 'eee' with face vibration)"
]
task = random.choice(tasks)
print(f"Next task: {task}")
