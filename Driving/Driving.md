# Driving Theory Log

Studying for the driving theory test in short bursts (5 min), logged in commits to make it feel like coding. Let’s conquer the road rules!

## Current Focus
- **Topics**: Road signs, traffic rules, hazard perception (TBD: update with my focus).
- **Resources**: [e.g., Official theory book, YouTube videos, free quizzes, or TBD].
- **Starting Point**: [e.g., Familiar with basic signs, need to memorize rules].

## Study Log
- **Date: [Today’s date, e.g., 2025-04-25]**
  - Topic: Road signs (5 min).
  - Notes: Memorized yield and stop signs. Yield = “be polite” mnemonic.
  - Commit: “Studied 5 signs, updated theory.md”

- **Date: [TBD]**
  - Topic: [e.g., Traffic rules, 5 min]
  - Notes: [e.g., Learned speed limits, urban = 30 mph like a slow loop]
  - Commit: [e.g., “Studied speed limits, updated theory.md”]

## Mnemonics & Notes
- Red triangle = warning, like a code error.
- Red circle = no entry, like a firewall block.
- [Add more as I study, e.g., hazard perception tips]

## Wins
- [e.g., Week 1: Studied 4x, nailed 15 signs!]
- [Add weekly reflections, e.g., passed a practice quiz]
