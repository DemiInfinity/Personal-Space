# Personal-Space

This is my space to track personal goals like **voice feminization** and **driving theory**, using Git commits as a diary. It’s a low-friction way to stay consistent, celebrate wins, and make progress feel like coding a project.

## Goals
- **Voice Feminization**: Practice pitch, resonance, and more to align my voice with my identity.
- **Driving Theory**: Study rules and signs to pass the theory test and learn to drive.
- *(Optional: Add other goals like housework or social tasks later.)*

## How It Works
- Do short bursts of voice practice (2-3 min) or theory study (5 min) before commits.
- Log notes in `voice.md` or `theory.md`.
- Write commit messages like a diary (e.g., “Practiced pitch 3 min, studied 5 signs”).
- Use `tasks.md` for daily nudges.
- Review commits weekly to see progress (`git log --oneline | grep -i voice`).

Let’s make these goals fun and achievable!
