# 6-Month Chores Plan

This plan outlines a 6-month journey to build and maintain consistent household chore habits as an adult, ensuring a functional living space. It’s designed for my **Adaptive Sprinter** and **Creative** ADHD style, using my **personal fit Git repository** with **commits as a diary** to track progress. The plan leverages my developer workflow, avoids scheduling apps, and integrates with my voice feminization and driving theory goals for a cohesive approach.

## Overview
- **Goal**: Establish a routine for household chores (e.g., cleaning, organizing, maintenance) to maintain a tidy, functional home over 6 months.
- **Approach**:
  - **Micro-Tasks**: 5–10 min daily chore tasks (e.g., wipe counters, sort laundry) to fit my Sprinter bursts.
  - **Progressive Habits**: Build consistency by starting with high-impact chores and adding variety, like coding small features.
  - **Creative Logging**: Use `chores.md` and commits to log tasks, vent frustrations, and celebrate wins, framing chores as a coding project.
  - **Adaptable Adjustments**: Rotate chores to avoid boredom, leveraging my adaptability.
  - **ADHD Support**: Address procrastination and forgetting with nudger prompts and small wins to boost motivation.
  - **Integration**: Tie chores to voice and driving tasks in the same repo.
- **Tools**:
  - Personal fit repo (`chores.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `wins.md`).
  - Python nudger script to prompt tasks.
  - Basic cleaning supplies (e.g., sponge, trash bags).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Managing a typical adult living space (e.g., apartment, shared house).
  - Starting with inconsistent chore habits, aiming for daily maintenance.
  - Emotional barriers (e.g., overwhelm, boredom) may arise, addressed via venting in commits.

## Background
- **Chores**: Adult chores include cleaning (e.g., dishes, sweeping), organizing (e.g., laundry, desk), and maintenance (e.g., trash, plants). They ensure a livable space but can feel repetitive.
- **ADHD Challenges**: Procrastination, boredom with routine tasks, and forgetting (like social messages) require short, engaging tasks and low-friction tracking.
- **Timeline**: 6 months is enough to build daily chore habits (1–3 months) and maintain them (4–6 months), with ~5–10 min daily tasks.

## 6-Month Plan
Divided into six 1-month phases, each with chore tasks and repo-based tracking. Tasks are Sprinter-friendly (5–10 min), with Creative logging to stay motivated.

### Month 1: Core Chore Habits
- **Focus**: Build daily chore habit with high-impact tasks (e.g., kitchen, trash).
- **Chores (5–10 min daily)**:
  - **Cleaning (5 min)**: Wipe kitchen counter, wash 5 dishes, or sweep a small area.
  - **Maintenance (5 min)**: Take out trash, empty recycling, or water plants.
- **Milestone**: Do chores 5–6x/week, keep kitchen and trash managed.
- **Repo Workflow**:
  - **Log in `chores.md`**:
    ```markdown
    - **Date: 2025-04-25**
      - Chore: Wipe kitchen counter (5 min)
      - Notes: Counter shiny, feels like a clean codebase.
      - Commit: “Wiped counter, updated chores.md”
    ```
  - **Commit**: `git add . && git commit -m "Wiped kitchen counter 5 min, updated chores.md"`
  - **Creative Note**: “Debugged kitchen counter like a pro!”
  - **Vent**: “Dishes boring, but got 5 min done.”
- **Tracking**:
  - Note chore frequency weekly in `chores.md`: “Week 1: Chores 5x, kitchen cleaner.”
  - Mark tasks done in `tasks.md` (e.g., `[x] Do a 5-min cleaning task # 1234`).
- **Voice/Driving Tie-In**:
  - Practice voice 2–3 min or study theory 5 min, log in `voice.md`/`theory.md`.
  - Commit: “Wiped counter, practiced voice pitch 3 min, updated chores.md, voice.md.”

## Nudger Script
Prompts voice, driving, and chore tasks, logged in `tasks.md`.
```python
import random
from datetime import datetime

tasks = [
    "Practice voice pitch for 2-3 min (e.g., hum or pitch slides)",
    "Practice voice resonance for 2-3 min (e.g., say 'eee' with face vibration)",
    "Practice voice articulation for 2-3 min (e.g., read a sentence softly)",
    "Study 5 driving theory signs or rules for 5 min",
    "Study hazard perception for 5 min (e.g., watch a video)",
    "Do a 5-min cleaning task (e.g., wipe kitchen counter, sweep a room)",
    "Do a 5-min organizing task (e.g., sort laundry, tidy desk)",
    "Do a 5-min maintenance task (e.g., take out trash, water plants)"
]

task = random.choice(tasks)
print(f"Next task: {task}")
with open("tasks.md", "a") as f:
    f.write(f"- [ ] {task} # {random.randint(1000, 9999)} @ {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}\n")
