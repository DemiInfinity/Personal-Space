# Daily Tasks

Quick list to nudge me toward voice training and driving theory. Check before coding, do 1-2 tasks, and log in commits. Keep it simple and fun!

## Today: [Today’s date, e.g., 2025-04-25]
- [ ] Practice voice pitch or resonance for 2-3 min
- [ ] Study 5 driving theory signs or rules
- [ ] Study hazard perception for 5 min (e.g., watch a video) # 5936 @ 2025-04-25 21:29

## Notes
- Update daily with 1-2 tasks per goal.
- Mark done with [x] when completed.
- Log in commits (e.g., “Practiced voice 2 min, studied 5 signs”).
- Vent or celebrate in commits if needed!
