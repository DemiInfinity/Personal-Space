# Voice Feminization Log

Tracking my journey to feminize my voice through daily practice. Aiming for 2-3 min sessions, logged in commits like a coding project. Let’s debug and level up my voice!

## Current Focus
- **Skills**: Pitch, resonance, articulation (TBD: update with my specific goals).
- **Starting Point**: [e.g., Pitch feels low, resonance needs work, or just exploring].
- **Resources**: [e.g., YouTube tutorials, trans voice forums, or self-guided].

## Practice Log
- **Date: [Today’s date, e.g., 2025-04-25]**
  - Exercise: Humming for pitch (2 min).
  - Notes: Felt higher but breathy. Recorded a clip.
  - Commit: “Practiced pitch 2 min, updated voice.md”

- **Date: [TBD]**
  - Exercise: [e.g., Resonance (say ‘eee’ with forward vibration), 3 min]
  - Notes: [e.g., Felt vibration in face, need more control]
  - Commit: [e.g., “Practiced resonance 3 min, updated voice.md”]

## Ideas for Exercises
- Pitch: Hum low to high, slide pitch like a siren.
- Resonance: Say “mmm” or “eee” to feel face vibration.
- Articulation: Read a sentence softly, focus on clarity.
- [Add more as I explore, e.g., from tutorials or forums]

## Wins
- [e.g., Week 1: Practiced 5x, pitch starting to shift!]
- [Add weekly or monthly reflections, e.g., compared recordings]
