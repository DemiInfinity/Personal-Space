# 6-Month Voice Feminization Plan (140 Hz to 200–210 Hz)

This plan outlines a 6-month journey to increase my speaking voice pitch from ~140 Hz to 200–210 Hz, aligning with a feminine vocal range. It’s designed for my **Adaptive Sprinter** and **Creative** ADHD style, using my **personal fit Git repository** with **commits as a diary** to track progress. The plan leverages my developer workflow, avoids scheduling apps, and integrates with my driving theory goal for a cohesive approach.

## Overview
- **Goal**: Raise speaking pitch from ~140 Hz (lower, masculine range) to 200–210 Hz (feminine range) in 6 months.
- **Approach**:
  - **Micro-Practices**: 2–5 min daily sessions (1–2x/day) for pitch-raising exercises (e.g., humming, sirens, speaking).
  - **Progressive Milestones**: Increase pitch ~10–20 Hz/month, building vocal muscle memory.
  - **Creative Logging**: Use `voice.md` and commits to log practice, vent emotions, and celebrate wins, framing it as a coding project.
  - **Adaptable Adjustments**: Rotate exercises to avoid boredom, leveraging my adaptability.
  - **Emotional Support**: Address frustration/dysphoria with venting in commits and self-compassion.
  - **Integration**: Tie voice practice to coding and driving theory tasks.
- **Tools**:
  - Personal fit repo (`voice.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `wins.md`).
  - Python nudger script to prompt tasks.
  - Pitch-tracking app (e.g., Vocal Pitch Monitor, PitchLab) or tuner (used weekly).
  - Free resources (e.g., YouTube tutorials, trans voice communities).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Self-guided practice, open to free resources.
  - No vocal health issues (consult a speech therapist if strain occurs).
  - Emotional barriers (e.g., dysphoria) may arise, addressed via venting.

## Background
- **Pitch**: Fundamental frequency (Hz) determines voice pitch. 140 Hz is lower (masculine range); 200–210 Hz is feminine (180–220 Hz typical).
- **Training**: Exercises strengthen vocal folds to vibrate faster (higher Hz). Progress is gradual, like coding or driving skills.
- **Timeline**: ~60–70 Hz increase in 6 months is feasible with 5–10 min daily practice, targeting ~10–20 Hz/month.
- **Measurement**: Use pitch app weekly (not daily) to avoid fixation, plus recordings for subjective feedback.

## 6-Month Plan
Divided into six 1-month phases, each with exercises, milestones, and repo-based tracking. Sessions are Sprinter-friendly (2–5 min), with Creative logging to stay motivated.

### Month 1: Foundation and Initial Shift (Target: ~150–160 Hz)
- **Focus**: Build habit, strengthen vocal muscles, raise pitch slightly.
- **Exercises (2–5 min daily)**:
  - **Warm-Up (1 min)**: Gentle humming (~140 Hz).
  - **Pitch Slides (2 min)**: Hum low to high (siren), aim ~150 Hz, hold high note 5 sec. Repeat 3–4x.
  - **Vowel Sounds (2 min)**: Say “eee” or “ahh” at ~150 Hz, sustain 5 sec. Repeat 5x, relaxed.
- **Milestone**: Practice 5–6x/week, sustain ~150 Hz in exercises, slight speaking pitch shift.
- **Repo Workflow**:
  - **Log in `voice.md`**:
    ```markdown
    - **Date: 2025-04-25**
      - Exercise: Humming + pitch slides (3 min)
      - Notes: Hit ~150 Hz in slides, feels high but doable. Recorded clip.
      - Commit: “Practiced pitch 3 min, updated voice.md”
    ```
  - **Commit**: `git add . && git commit -m "Practiced voice pitch 3 min, hit ~150 Hz, updated voice.md"`
  - **Creative Note**: “Debugging pitch: climbed to 150 Hz, vocal ninja mode!”
  - **Vent**: “Pitch feels weird, but got 2 min done.”

```python
import random

tasks = [
    "Practice voice pitch for 2-3 min (e.g., hum or pitch slides)",
    "Practice voice resonance for 2-3 min (e.g., say 'eee' with face vibration)",
    "Practice voice articulation for 2-3 min (e.g., read a sentence softly)",
    "Study 5 driving theory signs or rules"
]
task = random.choice(tasks)
print(f"Next task: {task}")
